# PureReactState
Delving into Class Based State, Hooks State, Reducers, Context, Data Fetching and Thunks.

# What are some examples of the kinds of state we use?
- Model Data: The nouns in your application
- View/UI State: Are those nouns sorted in ascending or descending order?
- Session State: Is the user even logged in?
- Communication: Are we in the process of fetching the nouns from the server?
- Location: Where are we in the application? Which nouns are we looking at?
